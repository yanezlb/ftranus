TRANUS
======

TRANUS is an integrated land use and transport modeling package. The system combines a state-of-the-art model of activities location and interaction, land use and the real estate market, with a comprehensive multimodal transport model. The combination of these two models produces the highest benefits, but the transport model may be used as a stand-alone component, especially for short-term projections. The main characteristics of the model are:

- Very flexible activities location and land use model, applicable to a wide range of scales and contexts.
- Transport model to represent both passengers and freight movements and multiple interacting modes (intermodality).
- Probabilistic logit combined modal split and assignment procedure, exclusive of the TRANUS model.
- Detailed and effective representation of the public transport system, with multiple transfers, waiting times, integrated fares, etc.
- Economic, financial and environmental evaluation.
- Powerful graphic interface with an intelligent database (object-oriented) and capable of dealing with multiple scenarios.
- Applicable to any scale, from detailed urban level to regional and national models.
- Long-term projections for strategic studies.
- Very detailed short-term projections.
